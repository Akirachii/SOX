## How to use Serverfix archives.

First as we can see from they're names, thins files are made for diferent **machines**.
### Here we have our fixes url.
* [SERVER SCRIPT](https://github.com/Akirachii/SOX/blob/main/AV2/SERVERFIX/SERVERFIX.sh)
* [LOCAL MACHINE SCRIPT](https://github.com/Akirachii/SOX/blob/main/AV2/SERVERFIX/LOCALFIX.sh)

### Here we have user steps.
1. First we will give execution permit to these two files.
1. Then we'll execute *SERVERFIX* from the \"server\" always making sure the system *apache2* is on.
1. After that, the second script, *LOCALFIX* must be executed in local machine, also making sure the machines are in the same network. 
1. The final step is waiting for the comand to promt all the repeated mac with diferent ip.
